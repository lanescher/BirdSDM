All files were imported from the folder BirdSDM, shared by Dr. Dave Miller & team.

Each species has 4 scripts containing 16 model across them. To run the models separately using a HPC, these 4 files were separated into 16 files.

In reviewing the paper, C. Lane Scher found highly correlated variables (forested land/canopy cover; temp/latitude). We removed these covariates from the model and needed to regenerate the GAM code and refit the JAGS models.

In this process, we identified some issues and addressed them in the following ways:
  - Model 8 (across species) contains priors for b[1:3] that are user-defined, not generated by the function `jagam`. All of the indices for the splines need to be manually increased by 2 to accommodate the user-defined b2 and b3.
  - Models 5 and 7 have incorrect indices in line 79 (cawa5.R) and have been changed from 9287:16204 to 9218:15947.
